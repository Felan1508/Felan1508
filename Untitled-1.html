        <h2>VietNam is a beautiful place to travel to!!</h2>
        <img src="img/images.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Vietnam's scenery is a breathtaking mix of lush rice terraces, emerald mountains, and winding rivers.
            Towering limestone cliffs rise dramatically from the turquoise waters of Ha Long Bay, creating an iconic
            landscape. Along the countryside, vibrant green fields stretch as far as the eye can see, dotted with
            traditional villages and swaying bamboo groves</p>
        <img src="img/ao_dai.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The Ao Dai is Vietnam’s traditional dress, known for its elegance and graceful silhouette, often worn for
            celebrations and special occasions. This fitted, long tunic is paired with loose pants, symbolizing both
            cultural heritage and the beauty of Vietnamese women. Modern Ao Dai designs blend traditional and
            contemporary styles, with vibrant colors and intricate patterns, making it a timeless icon in Vietnamese
            fashion.</p>

        <img src="img/traffic.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Vietnam’s bustling streets are filled with motorbikes, weaving around each other in a fast-paced, seemingly
            chaotic dance. Crossing the road can be an adventure, as pedestrians navigate through a sea of scooters,
            honking cars, and bicycles. In cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, the vibrant traffic is an iconic part
            of daily life, reflecting the dynamic energy of Vietnam. </p>
